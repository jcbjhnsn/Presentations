Speaker's notes
Philosophy in my Science?!

A Primer on Philosophy
  * Love of wisdom
  * Seeking questions and answers for and to everything
  * Reflective Equilibrium
  * An activity, a doing, a journey
  * Nature of the world
  * Right way to build arguments
  * Epistemology (how do we know what we know?)
  * Ethics
  * Politics
  * What is beauty?

Different from Science, although science was once called "natural philosophy". Science tried to understand the natural world, philosophy tries to clarify and justify any form of thinking. It seeks truth by reason and argument.

Induction is circular and impossible.  
What holds science together? In*duct*ion tape.

## Realists vs Anti-realists

The world Exists

* Realists
  * Scientific theories are an approximation of reality
  * It would be "miraculous" if Science could produce accurate predictions, if the theories generating those predictions did not, describe and approximate reality in a meaningful way.
  * Even though past theories have been proven wrong, each new theory seems to provide greater precision and is therefore getting closer to the "truth".

* Anti-realists
 * Science is a pragmatic enterprise that merely generates "functioning" theories.
 * Pessimistic meta-induction
   * Every past theory has been proven to be wrong. Therefore we have no reason to believe any current or future theory won't be proven wrong.
   * These theories might have immediate pragmatic value in the "human experience", however it is impossible to test the claim that they approximate the true nature of reality. Reality is fundamentally unknowable.
