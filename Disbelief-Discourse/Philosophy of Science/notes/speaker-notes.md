Philosophy in my Science?!
Philosophers can help justify scientific reasoning through skilled application of logic and formal reasoning.
* Why does Science work?



# [slide]
## A Primer on Philosophy
* Love of wisdom
* Seeking questions and answers for and to everything
* An activity, a doing, a journey
* Nature of the world
* Right way to build arguments
* Epistemology (how do we know what we know?)
* Ethics
* Politics
* What is beauty?

Philosophy is different from Science, although science was once called "natural philosophy". Science tried to understand the natural world, philosophy tries to clarify and justify any form of thinking. It seeks truth by reason and argument.

### Reflective Equilibrium

New evidence and ideas should constantly enter one's model of reality. A wise (rational?) person adjusts their beliefs accordingly. The processes of moving forward and being less wrong is liberating.

* Theories are complex packages with webs of facts and data which are not easily unpacked or broken by singular facts.
	* A disagreement between theory and fact tells us that something is wrong, but not what.
	* The core theory might be fundamentally broken
	* Maybe some minor modifications would resolve the discrepancies
		* For example, Kepler adjusted the	Heliocentric Copernican model of planetary orbits from circular to elliptical to better fit the data
	* The data might be wrong - bad humans or instruments
* W.V.O. Quine argued that whenever there is a discrepancy in our understanding of the world one could change any of the interconnected statement that constitute our "web" of knowledge in order to account for the discrepancy
	* Quine even held that logic itself might need to be altered, if we encountered enough problems when applying it

## Science
And The Nature of Science

### What is Science anyways?
* The best-known and most effective predictive-model-generating tool of the natural world
* A process that takes place over years and advances with the contributions of many efforts.

### What Science is not, and the limits thereof
* **Science is not:**
	* A truth-generator
	* Science is not ideas, nor is it the context of discovery.
		* Discovery is typically non-rational
		* Ideas can happen to anyone in any context, like showering, or taking a walk.
		* Or taking drugs...
		* These things are important for hypothesis generation, but alone they are not science

### What Holds Science Together?

* in**DUCT**ion tape!

### How does Science work?

#### Induction

* Science is inductive \[hume] [what about his fork?]
	* All swans are white
		* What if the next swan is black?
	* We can never tell if our observations are correct

# [slide]

### Philosophy of science slide

So, back to Philosophy of Science.

Philosophers can help justify scientific reasoning through skilled application of logic and formal reasoning.
* Why does Science work?
* How does it work?
* How can we improve?
* What is the nature of nature?
* And what about metaphysics?

#### How do we justify our ideas?
* How can we tell that our theories are valid?
* Are our ideas supported by the facts?

### Demarcation Problem

Telling the sense from the nonsense on stilts

The demarcation problem in the philosophy of science is about how to distinguish between science and nonscience,[1] and more specifically, between science and pseudoscience.[2][3] The debate continues after over a century of dialogue among philosophers of science and scientists in various fields, and despite broad agreement on the basics of scientific method.[4][5]

#### Popper's Science  
* remember what I said about induction and swans?
* [Karl Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Wikipedia Entry: Karl Popper")
	* Science according to Popper
		* **Falsification**
		* Science makes progress by throwing out the bad. (Falsification)
			* Pros:
				* Rapid iteration, an extreme spirit of Reflective Equilibrium
			* Cons
				* Easy to "rescue" theories by changing them, instead of confronting the fundamental problems

Falsifiability is the demarcation criterion proposed by Karl Popper as opposed to verificationism: 

> "statements or systems of statements, in order to be ranked as scientific, must be capable of conflicting with possible, or conceivable observations".

[15] Popper saw demarcation as a central problem in the philosophy of science. Unlike the Vienna Circle, Popper stated that his proposal was not a criterion of "meaningfulness".

## Postpositivism and Kuhn

Thomas Kuhn, an American historian and philosopher of science, is often connected with what has been called postpositivism or postempiricism. In his 1962 book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, Kuhn divided the process of doing science into two different endeavors, which he called normal science and extraordinary science (which he sometimes also called "revolutionary science"). "In Kuhn's view, 'it is normal science, in which Sir Karl's sort of testing does not occur, rather than extraordinary science which most nearly distinguishes science from other enterprises'…"[15] That is, the utility of a scientific paradigm for puzzle-solving, which suggests solutions to new problems while continuing to satisfy all of the problems solved by the paradigm that it replaces.

>Kuhn's view of demarcation is most clearly expressed in his comparison of astronomy with astrology. Since antiquity, astronomy has been a puzzle-solving activity and therefore a science. If an astronomer's prediction failed, then this was a puzzle that he could hope to solve for instance with more measurements or with adjustments of the theory. In contrast, the astrologer had no such puzzles since in that discipline "particular failures did not give rise to research puzzles, for no man, however skilled, could make use of them in a constructive attempt to revise the astrological tradition"… Therefore, according to Kuhn, astrology has never been a science.[15]
*—Sven Ove Hansson, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Science and Pseudo-Science"*

Popper criticized Kuhn's demarcation criterion, saying that astrologers are engaged in puzzle solving, and that therefore Kuhn's criterion recognized astrology as a science. He stated that Kuhn's criterion leads to a "major disaster…[the] replacement of a rational criterion of science by a sociological one".[15]

## Realists vs Anti-realists

The world Exists

## Realists
* Scientific theories are an approximation of reality
* It would be "miraculous" if Science could produce accurate predictions, if the theories generating those predictions did not, describe and approximate reality in a meaningful way.
* Even though past theories have been proven wrong, each new theory seems to provide greater precision and is therefore getting closer to the "truth".

# [slide]
## Anti-realists
* Science is a pragmatic enterprise that merely generates "functioning" theories.
* Pessimistic meta-induction
 * Every past theory has been proven to be wrong. Therefore we have no reason to believe any current or future theory won't be proven wrong.
 * These theories might have immediate pragmatic value in the "human experience", however it is impossible to test the claim that they approximate the true nature of reality. Reality is fundamentally unknowable.
