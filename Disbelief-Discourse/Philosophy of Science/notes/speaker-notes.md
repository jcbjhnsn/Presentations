Philosophy in my Science?!

## A Primer on Philosophy
* Love of wisdom
* Seeking questions and answers for and to everything
* Reflective Equilibrium
* An activity, a doing, a journey
* Nature of the world
* Right way to build arguments
* Epistemology (how do we know what we know?)
* Ethics
* Politics
* What is beauty?

Philosophy is different from Science, although science was once called "natural philosophy". Science tried to understand the natural world, philosophy tries to clarify and justify any form of thinking. It seeks truth by reason and argument.

### Reflective Equilibrium

New evidence and ideas should constantly enter one's model of reality. A wise (rational?) person adjusts their beliefs accordingly. The processes of moving forward and being less wrong is liberating.

* Theories are complex packages with webs of facts and data which are not easily unpacked or broken by singular facts.
	* A disagreement between theory and fact tells us that something is wrong, but not what.
	* The core theory might be fundamentally broken
	* Maybe some minor modifications would resolve the discrepancies
		* For example, Kepler adjusted the	Heliocentric Copernican model of planetary orbits from circular to elliptical to better fit the data
	* The data might be wrong - bad humans or instruments
* W.V.O. Quine argued that whenever there is a discrepancy in our understanding of the world one could change any of the interconnected statement that constitute our "web" of knowledge in order to account for the discrepancy
	* Quine even held that logic itself might need to be altered, if we encountered enough problems when applying it




## Philosophy of Science
And The Nature of Science

Philosophers can help justify scientific reasoning through skilled application of logic and formal reasoning.
* Why does Science work?

### Demarcation Problem

Telling the sense from the nonsense on stilts

[nonsense on stilts](http://www.amazon.com/Nonsense-Stilts-Tell-Science-Bunk/dp/0226667863)

### What is Science anyways?
* The best-known and most effective predictive-model-generating tool of the natural world
* A process that

### What Science is not, and the limits thereof
* **Science is not:**
	* A truth-generator
	* Science is not ideas, nor is it the context of discovery.
		* Discovery is typically non-rational
		* Ideas can happen to anyone in any context, like showering, or taking a walk.
		* Or taking drugs...
		* These things are important for hypothesis generation, but alone they are not science

### What Holds Science Together?

#### inDUCTion tape!

### How does Science work?

#### Induction

* Science is inductive \[hume] [what about his fork?]
	* All swans are white
	* We can never tell if our observations are correct

#### Popper's Science

* [Karl Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Wikipedia Entry: Karl Popper")
	* Science according to Popper
		* **Falsification**
		* Science makes progress by throwing out the bad. (Falsification)
			* Pros:
				* Rapid iteration, an extreme spirit of Reflective Equilibrium
			* Cons
				* Easy to "rescue" theories by changing them, instead of confronting the fundamental problems

#### What cannot be answered by science

### How do we justify our ideas?
* How can we tell that our theories are valid?
* Are our ideas supported by the facts?
* Empirical Observation


### Khun and Paradigm shifts


* evolutionary epistemology
* Bayesianism

## Realists vs Anti-realists

The world Exists

* Realists
	* Scientific theories are an approximation of reality
	* It would be "miraculous" if Science could produce accurate predictions, if the theories generating those predictions did not, describe and approximate reality in a meaningful way.
	* Even though past theories have been proven wrong, each new theory seems to provide greater precision and is therefore getting closer to the "truth".

* Anti-realists
 * Science is a pragmatic enterprise that merely generates "functioning" theories.
 * Pessimistic meta-induction
	 * Every past theory has been proven to be wrong. Therefore we have no reason to believe any current or future theory won't be proven wrong.
	 * These theories might have immediate pragmatic value in the "human experience", however it is impossible to test the claim that they approximate the true nature of reality. Reality is fundamentally unknowable.

### Opinion
We have the world [box] it returns consistent results to the human experience
