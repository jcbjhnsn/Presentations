New evidence and ideas should constantly enter one's model of reality. A wise (rational?) person adjusts their beliefs accordingly. The processes of moving forward and being less wrong is liberating.

* Theories are complex packages with webs of facts and data which are not easily unpacked or broken by singular facts.
  * A disagreement between theory and fact tells us that something is wrong, but not what.
  * The core theory might be fundamentally broken
  * Maybe some minor modifications would resolve the discrepancies
    * For example, Kepler adjusted the  Heliocentric Copernican model of planetary orbits from circular to elliptical to better fit the data
  * The data might be wrong - bad humans or instruments
* W.V.O. Quine argued that whenever there is a discrepancy in our understanding of the world one could change any of the interconnected statement that constitute our "web" of knowledge in order to account for the discrepancy
  * Quine even held that logic itself might need to be altered, if we encountered enough problems when applying it

What are the limits of Science?
What cannot be answered by science

Science is not ideas

How do we justify our ideas?
Are our ideas supported by the facts?
Philosophers can help justify scientific reasoning through skilled application of logic and formal reasoning.

* Science is inductive.
  * All swans are white
  * We can never tell if our observations are correct
* [Karl Popper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper "Wikipedia Entry: Karl Popper")
  * Science according to Popper
    * Science makes progress by throwing out the bad. (Falsification)
      * Problems
        * Easy to "rescue" theories by changing them, instead of confronting the fundamental problems

## Realists vs Anti-realists

The world Exists

Realists
  Scientific theories are an approximation of reality
  It would be "miraculous" if Science could produce accurate predictions, if the theories generating those predictions did not, describe and approximate reality in a meaningful way.
  Even though past theories have been proven wrong, each new theory seems to provide greater precision and is therefore getting closer to the "truth".

Anti-realists
 Science is a pragmatic enterprise that merely generates "functioning" theories.
 Pessimistic meta-induction
   Every past theory has been proven to be wrong. Therefore we have no reason to believe any current or future theory won't be proven wrong.
   These theories might have immediate pragmatic value in the "human experience", however it is impossible to test the claim that they approximate the true nature of reality. Reality is fundamentally unknowable.
